# FindMySound

A Spotify app that visualizes your tastes in music and allows you to discover new music at a moments notice.

## Motivation
I consider myself quite a music junkie, with very particular tastes. It's always been tough for me to find artists that I fall in love with instantly, so I wanted to make it easier for people to use their existing listening habits to find similar artists.

##Technologies Used
ES6, Node.js, Express, EJS
